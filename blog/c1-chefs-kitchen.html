<p> The DBC experience seems to be characterized by the unwavering commitment and constant support shown by all of its teachers and sudents. The community at DBC seems to be one of very high energy; Everyone at DBC is excited to be at DBC. It is a diverse community where each person brings along their own sets of expertise and their own ways of thinking. People come from many places and backgrounds, but they come to DBC with the same goal. To me DBC seems like a huge collaborative group project. People contribute in their own ways, listen, learn, seek out help and are also willing to give it. It is a program with many moving pieces and with no part that is not vital. I get the feeling that everyone at DBC is valued as equal and is essential to the success of the people around them. DBC is "just one big experiemnt" and the teachers and students alike are just in the "big mess together". <p>

<p> In order for the DBC environment to exist the "kitchen mindset" is definetly important. Although some people may view DBC like a menu item with a price tag, this is not the approach that will make your experience the most worthwile. In order to make the very most of DBC, a student should look towards the "kitchen mindset". Having a kitchen mindset is feeling a sense of responsibility and ownership of your own learning process. It means taking your education into your own hands and making it an amazing experience for yourself and your cohort. I plan on making the very most of my experience, and hopefully I blow my mind with how much I can learn. Having a kitchen mindset as opposed to a restaurant mindset completely changes the game. </p>

<p> I can already feel that with DBC will be far from easy. In fact, I have a feeling it may be the hardest thing I have ever done. At the very least you can say that I'm nervous. It will come many challenges and roadblocks, but I'm hoping that I wont let these obstacles define my experience. My experience will be determined by how I respond to them. Everyone at DBC is learning, both the teachers and the students, and there will be times when I feel lost but maybe also others where I take the lead. I think keeping an open mind and staying positive will both prove to be very critical along the way. I need to remember that everyone else is also learning and that many people will be feeling the same things I am feeling. I can predict that I will need to become more confortable asking questions and seeking help. I think knowing that the DBC staff wants to help will ease the process and will make me feel very supported. </p>

<p> I have always thought that DBC was going to be a real grind. This video definetly confirmed those thoughts and perhaps even more. It emphacized how much commitment is required to be successful at DBC; It reminded me that I am going to get my ass kicked. However, it was almost comforting to hear it again. Its good to know that everyone will struggle and everyone will succeed at DBC. There "were all in this big mess together" is an amazing supportive and encouraging thought. I am excited to devout as much time as necesary to DBC and the learning process and I definetly preparing myself to be blown away. </p>
