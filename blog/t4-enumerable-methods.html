<h3> Enumerable #Map <h3>

<p> A map is used when you want to transform each element in an array. It is possible to do this with a for loop, but if you want a transformed copy of the array without altering the original you should use map. The map method makes a copy of the array, so you can continue to alter the original array but also alter the new one seperatrely. </p>

<p> Map accepts a collection of code and acts upon each element in the collection. Map then returns a transformed collection. Lets take a look at an example </p>

<p> array= ['bob', 'sally', 'sue'].map{|name| name.capitalize} </p>
<p> puts array.join(", ") #=> "Bob, Sally, Sue" </p>

 <p> Make sense? </p>
<p> If you decide you want map to modify the array you can just use map! instead. Lets look at one more example. </p>

<p> array= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map{|a| a + a} </p>
<p> puts array.join(", ") #=> "2, 4, 3, 8, 10" </p>
