<h1> What is Stereotype Threat? </h1>

<p> Stereotype Threat tells how academic performance can be negatively affected by the awareness that ones behavior might be viewed through a racial stereotype. It means that one is always at risk of confirming their racial stereotype, which often leads them to underperform. Stereotype Threat has been proven to reduce practice time for tasks (which leads to underperformance), or can even lead students to cavoid an area of study. Many studies on stereotype threat began with people wondering why the college dropout rate for black students was so much higher than for white students? College is an environement that tests intellectual abilities and Black students felt threatened, because based on their identity they weren't expected to perform as highly. This feeling of being threatened by ones environment causes people to limit themselves and under value their abilites. Since these students cared about their work, the idea that they were being judged was distressing and ultimately lowered their ability to perform. </p>

<h3> Who does it effect? </h3>

<p> Stereotype Threat is known to effect any group of people; No one is immune to their own stereotypes. For example, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, hispanics, females in math, and "even white males when faced with the specter of asian superiority in math." </p>


<p> Stereotype Threat can be brought about in many situations. It is most frequent in situations where a certain characteristic is highlighted and it is easy to categorize oneself. There is limited research on the mechanisms behind stereotype threat, but one thing that has be shown is how stereotype threat can limit working memory, which leads to underperforming on intellectual tasks. </p>
