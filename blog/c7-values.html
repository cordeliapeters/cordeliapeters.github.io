<h1> Values </h1>

<p> When I think of the times when I have been the happiest and most proud in my life, these words come to mind: Ambition, Commitment, Competition, Close-Relationships, Efficiency, Excitement, Friendships. </p>

<p> In general, I try to live up to these values on a scale of 1-5: Ambition (5), Commitment (4), Competition (5), Close Relationships (5) (*This is the value I value the most), Efficiency (4), Excitement (3), Friendships (4). </p>

<p> I'd like to pick Ambition and Close Friendships as a pair of values that are really important to me. While these dont seem like they go hand in hand, my happiest and most proud moments have been when myself and close group of friends have accomplished something together or experienced something wonderful together. The first thing that comes to my mind is Lacrosse. My sophomore year of high school, me and 8 of my friends made the varisty lacrosse team. The team had recently graduated a large class of seniors and so this year was a big transition year for the program. Us 9 were young and very inexperienced but we meshed really well, right off the bat. However we had a losing record and didn't do very well that season. We came back the year later and were determined to win the league--despite the year before we knew we had it in us. This sounds clich√© writing it out, but we went on to win the new england title my junior and senior years. We went undefeated both years and were undoubtedly the best team in New England. What I love most about this memory is being with my nine best friends (all nine of us were tied at the hip) and achieving something, that after our dissapointing sophomore season, no one thought was possible. To me this is the perfect example of a group of close friends that will do anything for eachother, and who are all ambitious and share the same goal. </p>

<p> The last topic someone asked for my advice on is Efficiency. This is my first year living at home after going to boarding school and I am around my younger siblings a lot. They are freshman and sophomores in high school and are just beginning to experience heavy work loads. They ask about how to be efficient with their work and for different study habits and ideas.</p>

<p> In order to answer Release #5 I thought about lacrosse again. When were on the playing field, it doesnt matter what the girls look like, where we are all from, how long we've been playing, or who has the highest grades. All of these things that people think about in everyday life go out the window when we get onto the field. None of it matters. The only thing that matters is the girl, the stick, and what she can do with it. There are no excuses made, and everyone has a fair chance to play just as well as anyone else. This is the opinion I hold when looking at my classmates at school, teammates on the field, and my future classmates at DBC. We all come from different places and have different stories but we are all here to learn how to program. It doesn't matter the reasons why students have chosen to come to the school, or the different financial pressures we are under, but instead the only thing that is important is that we are all here together and that we all want to learn. This is what we should focus on.  </p>
