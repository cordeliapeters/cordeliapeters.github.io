<h1> What is Rails? </h1>

<p> Rails is an open source web application framework written in the Ruby Language. It is the framework for building websites with Ruby. Ruby is a general purpose programming language that is most commonly used in web programming. </p>

<p> Ruby is known for its simple syntax that doesnt require a lot of extra punctuation. It was created 20 years ago by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Ruby is designed to make programming and web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developed needs. Ruby requires less code to be written to perform the same task than in other programming languages like Java. As a beginner programmer that is experiencing Ruby and Java for the first time, it is already obvious that Ruby is more straightforward, and much less cluttered than Java. As a first-timer Java is much harder to learn, and Ruby comes to me much easier. I've spoken with other people who are learning the languages and Ruby's simple syntax is something that people across the board all recognize and enjoy.  </p>

<p> Rails is not exclusively written in the Ruby language. Rails is a software library that "extends beyond" the Ruby programming language.  It is a package library that is installed using the command line. It combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. As a student at DBC, I have had exposure to Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked most frequently with Ruby but understand that my education in web programming will cover all four languages. They are all essential to using  Rails. Rails is popular among web startups (especially because of the open source software libraries known as Ruby Gems) and helps developers make complex websites relatively quickly. </p>

<p> Rails, as I mentioned, makes assumptions about what the developers need, and adapts to those assumptions in order to make the process easier, quicker, and more fun. Because of this, Rails is known as opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a best way to do something and by design, it encourages the developer to do it that way. The way it is structures discourages certain alternatives and leads the developer on the path that it sees as best. </p>

<p> <strong> The Rails philosophy is built on two main principles: </strong> <p>

<ol> <Strong> DRY </strong> </ol>
<p> DRY is a principle of software development that says that every piece of knowledge must have its own simple way to be represented within a system. Writing code that is more DRY means that you dont use a lot of repetition and each line is as efficient as possible. DRY means that there is no excess language in your program. By not being reptitive, and staying as concise as possible, code is less susceptible to errors and easier to maintain. </p>

<ol> <strong> Convention over Configuration </strong> </ol>
<p>Rails has a certain set of ideas about how are the best ways to solve problems. This set of ideas is engrained in Rails, and it defeaults to this set of conventions. Rather than require the developer to be over specific, it makes assumptions about what he/she wants to do and adjusts to the task </p>
