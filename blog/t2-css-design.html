<h3> Prompt: What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding? </h3>

<h3> Margins </h3>
  <p> The Margin is the space around an element. The margin determines the distance between an element and its surrounding elements. It can also determine the distance between an element and the edge of the HTML document. You can adjust the margins in order to make elements come closer together or spread out across the page.  </p>
  <p> Setting a margin to auto, automatically centers the element on the page. If you want to be more specific about your margins you can edit the top, right, bottom, and left margins individually. This can be done on one line using "margin: (top)px (right)px (bottom)px (left)px;" or on four different lines, one for each side, like "margin-top: 10px;", "margin-right: 25px;" etc.</p>
  <p> It is important to remember that you can make your margin values negative as well. If you set "margin-left:-10px;" the element will actually move 10px to the left.</p>

<h3> Borders </h3>
  <p> Borders are slightly more obvious: they refer to the edge of the element. The Border is like a picture frame for an element, and can have a certain color, width and height. </p>
  <p> There are three styles that you can attribute to a border. You can change its width, its style (dashed or solid), and its color. These three qualities can all be written on a single line, for instance, "border: 10px dashed #ffffff;". The border-radius is another quality that is adjusted using pixels. A div with sharp corners has a "border-radius: 0px;" A div that has very rounded corners, almost an oval, maybe has a "border-radius:100px;" </p>

  <h3> Padding </h3>
  <p> Padding is the most complex concept of the three. Padding is the space between the content and the borders. Padding is like the white paper frame that often seperates the photo from the actual from in a picture frame. The Padding is the buffer between the content and the edge of the element. If you can picture it, I find the comparsion to a picture frame very helpful. </p>
  <p> Padding is set in the same way that your margins are set. ("padding-top: 10px;" or "padding: value value value value;"). These values are the distance between the border and the actual content, which is the innermost layer. </p>
