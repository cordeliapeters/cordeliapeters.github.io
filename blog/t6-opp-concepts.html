<h1> Variable Scope </h1>

<p> What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different? </p>

<p> Ruby supports four kinds of variables: Local, Instance, Class and Global Variables. Scope refers to where in a program a certain variable is accessible. <p>

<p> <strong> Local Variables </strong> start with a lowercase letter or an underscore and consist of letters, digits or underscores. Local variables are local to the place they are declared. For example a variable that is defined inside of a method cannot be accessed outside of that method. This variable thus has a local scope. At any given moment in a program you are in a certain local scope, and if you define a local variable in that moment it can only be accessible in the code construct that it was defined within. </p>

<p> <strong> Instance Variables </strong> always start with an @ sign and then consist of the same characters as the local variables. Instance variables are local to the instances of an object. If one instance of the object changes the value of the variable, when it is accessed again the variable reverts back to its original form. We can say that the change is local to the method etc. that made the change.  </p>


<p> <strong> Class Variables </strong> consist of the same characters as instance variables but are commenced with two @@ signs. Class Variables are accessible across all instances of the class. This means that if an object changes the value of the variable, the new value will be used in all other instances of the class. A class variable is like a global variable within a class.  </p>

<p> <strong> Global Variables </strong> are commenced with the $ dollar sign. Global variables have "Global scope" and are avaliable everywhere. Even if you start a new class or a method these global variables will remain avaliable to you. Global variables can be changed from anywhere in the program. </p>
