<h3> Variable Scope </h3>

<p> What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different? </p>

<p> Ruby supports four kinds of variables: Local, Instance, Class and Global.<p>

<p> <strong> Local Variables </strong> start with a lowercase letter or an underscore and consist of letters, digits or underscores.

At any given moment in a program you are in a certain local scope.

<p> <strong> Instance Variables </strong> always start with an @ sign and then consist of the same characters as the local variables. Instance Variables store information for individual objects.


<p> <strong> Class Variables </strong> consist of the same characters as instance variables but are commenced with two @@ signs.

Class variables store information per class hierarchy.

<p> <strong> Global Variables </strong> are commenced with the $ dollar sign. Global variables have "Global scope" and are avaliable everywhere. Even if you start a new class or a method these global variables will remain avaliable to you.
