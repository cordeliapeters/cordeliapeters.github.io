<h3> Ruby arrays vs. JavaScript arrays </h3>

<p> This blog post will discuss the difference between arrays in Ruby and arrays in Javascript. It will cover how they are first created, a few methods and how they differ (such as delete, reverse, all, any, index) and how to apply each to both of them. This is only a brief list of the differences but covers some of the basic differences between working with the two languages. </p>

<p> To create an empty array in ruby you can use array = []. If you want to begin the array with values in it simply add them in: array = ["1", "2"]. The same goes for JavaScript except you must first define it as a variable and end the statement with a semi-colon: var array= ["1", "2"];. If you want to push another letter into the array the  process is nearly identical: array.push("3"). The only difference is JavaScript will include a semicolon after the parentheses. </p>

<p> <strong> To reverse </strong> the array in ruby call array.reverse! and the ouput will be [3, 2, 1]. In JavaScript you must call array.reverse();. In JavaScript every function you enact on an array is followed by (). </p>

<p> <strong> To delete </strong> an item from the array in ruby we call array.delete_at(1). 1 refers to the index of the item we want to delete. In Javascript we call array.splice(1,1);. The first 1 refers to the index and the second 1 refers to how much we want to delete. </p>

<p> <strong> Refrencing an Index </strong> in Ruby is nearly the same as in Javastript. In Ruby, array.index(2) refers to the second index. In JavaScript, array.indexOf(2); does the same thing. Only a slight difference, but its these slight differences between the two that tend to cause (me) the most problems.</p>

<p> <strong> All. </strong> Using array = ["1", "2", "3"], if we want to check if all of the items in the array are less than 4 we do this: array.all?{|x| x < 4}. This will return true to our console. In order to execute this command in JavaScript we type array.every(function(x) {return x < 4;});. This will also return true. Remember its important to include the semi-colon at the end and to pay attention to the suble differences between the two languages. The same syntax applies to the command <strong> any </strong>. The concept of any differs from that of all (so pay attention to what you want!) but the syntax is the same. <p>

<p> <strong> Each </strong> is one of the most common words that I have been using so far in Phase 0. Thus, it is definetly important to understand the differences in how to apply it. In Ruby, if you want to put all of the elements in the array to the screen you do this: array.each{|x| puts x}. In JavaScript it is array.forEach (function(x) {console.log(x);}). The Ideas here are the same, the syntax only differs and (in my opinion) it comes out to be a little bit more complicated in JavaScript. <p>
