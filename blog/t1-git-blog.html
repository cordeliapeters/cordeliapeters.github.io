<h1> Git Blogging </h1>

<p> Version Control is helpful because it allows you to seperate yourself from the master version of you work and instead create a branch. The benefit of a branch is that you can edit your file without actually making any changes to the master version. Once you have edited your branch you have the option to merge the branch back with the master version. Branches encourage experimentation and a safety net that allows you to make changes without them directly changing the master version. </p>

<p> Git helps to track changes by saving different versions of your work as it develops. A programmer can "commit" versions of their work and then later have access to those earlier versions. Git allows you to label your commits so that there is a description attached to every version. In this way Git allows you to make changes to your work while also safegaurding the previous versions. Mentally, Git encourages programmers to try new things and make mistakes. If for example you introduce an error to your code, you can always revert back to a cleaner version (and then identify where the mistake is located). </p>

<p> GitHub is a remote "Hub" for programmers. Git is a software that operates locally on your computer via the command line. GitHub is a place where programmers can store their code and interact with other peoples code. GitHub is a great space for collaboration and group projects. Many people can work on the same code and then have their changes combined to create a master version. </p>
