<!--Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.

Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

Now, contemplate the idea of [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively. -->

My natural strength is in concrete thinking. I am a very direct communicator and I like to interact directly with people. I perfer to be told things at face value and to recieve straightforward feedback. I register and respond to information directly and do better when I recieve specific instructions. I can think Abstractly but it is not as strong as my conrete thinking. I like to be given direction and know what my task is. This could be an area of improvement for me at DBC if challenges are very open ended. I can imagine that tasks will call for a lot of creativity and innovative thinking and I hope that I can let go of wanting guidelines and embrace the freedom of making something on my own.

My ordering ability is squential. I have a  logical train of thought and think about things in a step-by-step manner. I like to plan out the steps and complete tasks one at a time. I have a habit of making lists of the things I need to do and as I do them, I cross them off the list. I have always made a list everynight, with school, work etc. Despite my orderly way of attacking problems, I definetly have a random side. I am very impulsive and love to do random things when opportunities present themselves. I am always in support of a change in plans if something new presents itself. Socially, I don't like to put plans in stone and perfer my life to be more spur of the moment. </p>

<p> My biggest struggle in Phase 0 so far has been the scheduling. I feel somewhat overwhelmed working full time and also completing the phase 0 requirements. I've unfortunately been out of town for the past two weekends and so I haven't had that free time to focus on DBC. I feel confident that I can finish all of the work, but have had trouble scheduling pair programming times. I've managed to squeeze them in, but there has definetly been some stress revolving around that. Very often, by the time I ask someone to pair with me they have already completed their pairing requirements for the week--and have even sometimes already planned their pairs for next week. I think it will be important for me to not let this stress me out and to take it one step at a time. Although it is tough not to compare myself to others (a bad habit I need to break) it will definetly be a very useful skill throughout DBC. </p>

<p> One more thing I'd love to work on over the next few months is working in groups. I've read that concrete sequential learners have trouble working in groups and that sometimes resonates with me. However, since programming is so new to me I think I will learn to love the group environment. I have never programmed before and I think working in groups with people at different levels and with different sets of expertise will actually be really nice. Anyways, I'm excited for the experience and I'm excited to learn from my peers and to contribute as much as I can. </p>
