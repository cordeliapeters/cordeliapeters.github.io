<h3> Example Class </h3>

<p> A class in Ruby always starts with the keyword Class. You end a class with the keyword end. As an example, I will create a class called Identity.</p>

<p> There are four types of variables in a Ruby Class. Local Variables are variables defined in a method and that are only avaliable within that method. Instance Variables are avaliable across all methods and are noted with @. Class Variables are avaliable across different objects and are noted with @@. lastly, Global Variables are avaliable across classes are are defined with the dollar sign $. Within Identity I need to initialize my variables. In this example my variables are instance variables so that they will be accessible across all of the methods within the class. </p>

<p> class Identity </p>
<p> def initialize (first_name, last_name, age)</p>
 <p>  @first_name=first_name</p>
 <p>  @last_name=last_name</p>
 <p>  @age=age</p>
 <p>end</p>

<p> Within the class are functions which are called methods. They are formatted like a normal method with def followed by the method name. In the Identity example, the method can call upon any of the three variables listed because they are instance variables. Thus I could write a method within Class that greeted the person by their first and last name </p>

<p> To create Objects within a Ruby Class we use new. Write the object name followed by the name of the class.new. </p>
