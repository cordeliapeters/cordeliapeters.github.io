<h3> Gender Inequality <h3>

<p> Once of the biggest problems in the tech world today is gender inequality. Technology is largely dominated by men and so is the workplace. Statistically, women hold only about one-quarter of all information technology jobs. In 2009 women held a 25% share of computing occupations. In addition to this fact, nearly half of these women in science, engineering and technology quit. Women have quit rates of 47% in Science, 39% in Engineering and 56% in Technology. Over half of these women that leave their jobs leave the tech world completely. 51% of women who quit do something entirely different and do not return to the tech world. Lets examine why this might be. </p>

<p> The tech world is a boys club. Ephrat Bitton, the director of algorithms at FutureAdvisor says "It's a boys club, and you have to try to get into it, and they're trying as hard as they can to prove you can't." Writing code is a high pressure job with very little rom for error. Many people (assumably men) argue that women are not suited for this position because of how brutal the code reviews etc. can be. There is definetly a difference of opinions on whether or not women are up to the task. However, despite this Ephrat went on to say that while she strongly believes women are up to the task, no woman should be expected to perform so highly in such a masculine atmosphere. Women are harshly judged and scrutinized to the point where Ephrat believes tech is an unfair workplace. </p>

<p> Aside from technical abilities, another hurdle is how people are talking about the issue. "Women in the technology press are talked about in the context of being women," said a technical woman, "and men are talked about in the context of being in technology." Women can also be very good at their jobs, but they are first recognized for being a woman before they are recognized for their technical abilities. </p>

<p> People have already begun working to cure this problem. There are women-only hacker spaces and programs to increase the number of women who attend tech conferences and get jobs in the tech industry. A program called Passion Projects, calls upon a technical woman to present her work each month; Girl Develop It is a nonprofit group to help women become software developers; Black Girls Code is a nonprofit that introduces young girls to the technology industry and opens a multitude of opportunities for them. These are just three of many female focused organizations in the tech world. Women are pushing for equality in the work place just as they are pushing for an equal role in the tech industry. </p>
