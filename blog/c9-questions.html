<h1> Perfect Questions <h1>

<p> When asking a question (verbally, in the google+ community, stack overflow etc.) it is important to first establish what you already know. In the most concise way possible, explain the understanding you have of the material and maybe give an example of the code you know. Next locate the gap in your understanding. I've found that it is better to phrase this as a specific question rather than something more general. "How can I loop through this array and add one to each integer?" will generate a much more constructive response than "I dont understand looping, can you help me?". It is most helpful to have an example to look at rather than speaking in general. I've experienced this a lot during pairing sessions and it is evident to me that questions are most helpful and constructive when they refrence an example. </p>

<p> The questions that did not get answered were the most general ones. In the first few weeks, feeling very overwhlemed with the new material, I tended to ask very general questions and wouldn't learn much from them. It was hard for people to help me when i couldnt identify my problem. I had the most constuctive conversations with people when i was able to refrence something specific or ask a question about an example that we could both look at. I learned the most working hands on with problems rather than having general conversations with people. </p>

<p> The more specific someone can be in formualting a question the better. It easier to give a more detailed and helpful response if the question isnt as open ended. Examples are useful and are helpful for making refrences and explaining processes. </p>
