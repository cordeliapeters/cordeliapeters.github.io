Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either in the community, to a a friend, or in Google). Were these good questions? What was good/ not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer?

If you can't think of your own questions, go to the Google+ community or stack overflow and analyze the questions that are there. What characteristics make up a good question? Were there any common characteristics in the questions that did not get answered?

Make sure you keep these in mind for DBC! We are huge fans of students asking questions, and you'll need to ask good questions to get helpful answers. You should also feel free to ask for clarification and to push for more clarification if you don't understand the answers you get.
