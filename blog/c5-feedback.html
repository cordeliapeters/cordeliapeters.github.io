<h3> Feedback </h3>

<p> So far I've really enjoyed all of my pairing sessions. I find that I learn much more during these sessions that last an hour to two hours than I do days by myself. Being able to talk with other people and ask questions is immensely helpful and has been a huge support to me so far. I was definetly timid to pair at first but I've recently noticed the benefits and how they greatly outweigh the nerves of pairing. </p>

<p> Being open and not being scared of making mistakes is a huge part of pairing. I've found that when I make a mistake or am forced to ask questions is when I learn the most. While pairing  weak spots become obvious and it is clear to me and my partner where there is the most room for improvement. While this sounds like a negative, often times the areas where one has a weak understanding their partner is very comfortable. In this way, partners can alternate explaning and answering eachothers questions until they have the same levels of understanding. </p>

<p> Vulnerability is a key emotion that arises while pairing. There any many moments when one will feel clueless and wont know the next step. It is definetly scary to be in this position but it is important to remain composed. In many of my past pairing sessions we have spent time researching on the internet and looking through ruby docs for methods and solutions. It is important to remember that your partner will also have questions, and that youre not the only one who is learning. </p>

<p> Kind, actionable, and specific feedback is constructive criticism that should allow the reciever to better themselves as a participant in pairing. It doesnt need to all be positive, it only needs to be stated in a way that suggests change or a move in a positive direction. It needs to be something the reciever can read and better themselves by responding to it. It is important that the feedback is specific so that the reciever can know exactly where they need improvement and how. </p>
