<h1> Conflict </h1>

<h3> Describe how you deal with conflict </h3>

<p> My mom and I have clashed since as long as I can remember. It's nothing too extreme, and we normally put our differences aside and simply continue on with whatevers going on. On a relative scale we are definetly pretty humaine and aren't outwardly aggressive towards eachother. We've just never been that close. And I'm starting to realize the reason for that may be because we are so similar. </p>

<p> We are both pretty impacient and easily irritable people. We both have our own buttons that can be pushed and respond pretty strongly when they are. She needs her space, and can get overwhelemed really easily. When there are too many things on her plate she snaps. I dont do well being asked repetitive questions, or listening to someone who sounds like they could go on forever. One of my biggest weaknesses is my patience and its something that I've been trying to work on for awhile. </p>

<p> There hasn't necesarily been a climax, or an explosion between the two of us, but ever since I got home from boarding school I can feel the tension growing. I can feel it, and my dad and other siblings can see it also. I've been away at boarding school for three years and have only come home for week long vacations really. I am taking a gap year now and am spending the whol year at home. It's been a huge adjustment, going from living on my own to living at home with my parents. I've developed my own routines and am used to having my own space to study and sleep when I need to. I ate in a loud busy dining hall and attended to my own work, my own dishes and my own responsibilites. It's been an interesting adjustment to come home and be thrown into a house full of six. I am now sharing a room with my younger sister, there are two dogs in the house, and a constant flurry of people coming in and out and things needing to be done. I have played a huge role in cooking meals, cleaning up after meals, driving carpools for my younger siblings and doing the most that I can to help out. </p>

<p> I remember one night my mom came into my room while I was working and told me that I needed to complain less. I looked at her astounded. I had done nearly everything she had asked without complaining once. She yelled at me for a few minutes and I responded passively by not saying anything, but it was all boiling up inside of me. For the first few weeks of my gap year things like this happened all the time. I was told I needed to be more conscientious, I needed to accelerate slower when I was driving etc. Everything I did was picked apart by my overly critical mom that felt like she needed to catch up on three years of parenting. It was excessive and each time it added to the tension between us. I understand that a lot of these comments stem from exterior stresses and pressures she was feeling, and not directly from me, but since we were spending so much time together I got the reprocussions more than anyone. Eventually I pointed a few of these things out to my mom. That I had never complained about helping out around the house, that I did my best to be contientious, and that while I knew I had problems with patience, I was making an effort to be more patient with my siblings, parents, dogs etc. She seemed very undrestanding and we've been better since then. I think there will always be a little tension there, because we seem to push eachothers buttons, but there is definetly a level of understanding because we see part of ourselves in the other person.</p>

<p> Something this has taught me is clear communication. It is important to be active in letting people know what you are thinking and feeling as opposed passively just accepting the situation. Secondly (this is something my mom always tells me), is that you can't change the other person and that you can only change yourself. I may not love everything my mom does and how she acts, but there is nothing I can do about that. The only thing I can do is change myself, and learn how to operate side-by-side with her despite our conflicts. I am still in the process of learning about myself and I hope my mom is looking into herself too. I think over time we will learn to accept our differenes (and our similarities!) and not be so sensitive to eachothers every move. </p>
