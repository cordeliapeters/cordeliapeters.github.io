                <h2> Looping with Ruby </h2>

                <h3> Looping with For </h3>
                    <p> When you loop with for you execute the code once for each element
                        in the expression. When looping with for a range is defined, in this
                        case the code will execute according to the values between 0 and 5.</p>

                <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
                for i in 0..5
                    puts "Value of local variable is #{i}"
                end
                </pre>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
                (0..5).each do |i|
                    puts "Value of local variable is #{i}"
                end
                </pre>


                <h3> Looping with While </h3>
                <p> Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same code a certain number of times.
                    The While loop executes code while the conditional is true. </p>

                <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
                while conditional [do]
                    code
                end
                </pre>


                <h3> Looping with Until </h3>
                    <p> Looping with Until is similar to looping with While except for the code is
                        executed until the conditional is true. Therefore it executes the code
                        as long as the conditional remains false. </p>

                <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
                until conditional [do]
                    code
                end
                </pre>

                    The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop.

                    The following for statement starts by declaring the variable i and initializing it to 0. It checks that i is less than nine, performs the two succeeding statements, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.
                </p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">

                    The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

                    The for..in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.

                    The following function takes as its argument an object. It then iterates over all the object's enumerable properties and returns a string of the property names and their values.
